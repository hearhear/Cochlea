Uber-awesome USB-capable firmware for the Bluetooth-based TV hearing aid Hear Hear
Built and configured with [Antares](https://github.com/nekromant/antares).

Written *FOR THE AVR*. It *WILL NOT WORK ON OTHER PLATFORMS*, as there is no (as of now) framework in place to redefine pin numbers, ports, access rules &c. You are welcome to do this and shoot me a PR, as I don't have time to port this to something other than what I'm designing the hardware with.
